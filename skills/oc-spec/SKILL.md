name: oc-spec
description: Deep product/software specification interviewer. Use when user wants to create or refine a product spec through in-depth interviews. Triggers on requests to interview about a spec, refine a spec, create a spec through questions, or when user shares a SPEC file and asks for detailed questioning. Also trigger when users want to "think through requirements", "figure out what to build", "clarify the design", "ask key questions before coding", or any request to systematically explore and document what to build before building it. Outputs a spec file ready to serve as a development plan starting point.

# OC-Spec: Deep Specification Interviewer

Create comprehensive product specifications through systematic, in-depth interviews that uncover critical implementation decisions early.

## File Location Convention

**All SPEC files MUST be stored in `.claude/spec/` directory within the project root.**

- **Read**: Look for existing specs in `.claude/spec/`
- **Create**: Always write new specs to `.claude/spec/`
- **Naming**: Use descriptive names like `.claude/spec/SPEC.md` or `.claude/spec/[feature-name]-spec.md`

Before starting, ensure the directory exists:
```bash
mkdir -p .claude/spec
```

## Core Workflow

1. **Check `.claude/spec/`** for existing SPEC or create directory if needed
2. **Read existing SPEC** (if found) or acknowledge starting from scratch
3. **Interview systematically** - ask multiple deep questions per round
4. **Track coverage** - ensure all critical areas are addressed
5. **Complete when** - user confirms AND all key areas covered
6. **Output SPEC** - write to `.claude/spec/` as development plan starting point

## Interview Strategy

### Question Principles

- Ask questions that **impact implementation decisions** - things that must be decided or ruled out early
- Prioritize **feasibility first**, then **extensibility**
- Avoid obvious questions - dig into non-trivial tradeoffs
- **Strictly limit each round to 3-5 questions.** This is critical for interview quality — dumping 10+ questions at once overwhelms the user and degrades the conversation into a checklist. Even when reviewing an existing spec with many gaps, pick the 3-5 most important questions for this round and save the rest for later rounds. A focused conversation that goes 4-5 rounds produces far better answers than a single massive question dump.
- Build on previous answers to go deeper

**Good vs bad question example:**
- Bad (too generic): "What's your data model?"
- Good (specific, decision-forcing): "Will document content live in the database itself or in object storage with only metadata in the DB? This directly affects how you implement full-text search and version history."

### Question Categories (Priority Order)

**1. Feasibility & Core Scope**
- What's the MVP vs future scope?
- What are the hard technical constraints?
- What existing systems must this integrate with?
- What's absolutely out of scope?

**2. Data & State**
- What data needs to persist vs ephemeral?
- Who owns the data? Where does it live?
- What's the source of truth for X?
- How does state flow between components?

**3. Edge Cases & Error Handling**
- What happens when X fails?
- How to handle partial success?
- What are the concurrent access scenarios?
- What inputs are invalid and how to respond?

**4. User Experience Decisions**
- What feedback does user need at each step?
- How to handle loading/waiting states?
- What's the undo/recovery story?
- How does this behave offline or degraded?

**5. Security & Permissions**
- Who can do what?
- What needs authentication vs authorization?
- What data is sensitive?
- What audit trail is needed?

**6. Performance & Scale**
- What's the expected load?
- What operations must be fast vs can be async?
- What are the caching strategies?
- How does this scale if 10x users?

**7. Extensibility & Maintenance**
- What's likely to change?
- What customization points are needed?
- How will this be tested?
- What monitoring/debugging is needed?

## Interview Execution

### Opening
```
I'll interview you to build a comprehensive spec. I'll ask multiple deep questions 
per round, focusing on decisions that impact implementation. Let me know when you 
feel we've covered enough, but I'll also flag if I think critical areas remain.

[If SPEC provided]: I've read the spec. Let me start with questions about [area].
[If from scratch]: Let's start with the core concept. What are you building and why?
```

### During Interview
- Group related questions together
- Explicitly note when moving to a new category
- Summarize key decisions after each round
- Flag assumptions that need validation
- Note areas marked for future consideration vs current scope
- **Show coverage progress at the end of each round** to give the user a sense of where we are and what's coming next. Format:
  ```
  Coverage: Core Scope ✅ | Data Model ✅ | Edge Cases → next | UX ○ | Security ○ | Performance ○ | Extensibility ○
  ```
- **Use the `AskUserQuestion` tool to present each round's questions.** Each question becomes a `question` in the tool, with 2-4 common options for quick selection (the tool automatically includes an "Other" option for free-form input). This lowers the barrier to answering while preserving flexibility. Max 4 questions per round (tool limit). Example:
  ```
  question: "Which storage approach do you prefer?"
  options: ["Relational DB (PostgreSQL/MySQL)", "Document DB (MongoDB)", "Filesystem + metadata index"]
  // User can pick one, or choose Other to type a custom answer
  ```
  After asking, do not continue with any further actions — no next-round questions, no SPEC generation. Wait for the user's response, then decide what to ask next.

### Completion Check
Before concluding, verify coverage:
- [ ] Core scope and MVP defined
- [ ] Key data models understood
- [ ] Critical edge cases addressed
- [ ] UX decisions for main flows
- [ ] Security model clear
- [ ] Performance expectations set
- [ ] Extension points identified

Ask user: "I believe we've covered the critical areas. Ready to generate the spec, or are there areas you want to explore further?"

## Notes

- The spec should be actionable - developers can start planning tasks from it
- Include rationale for non-obvious decisions
- Mark uncertainties explicitly rather than glossing over them
- Keep technical jargon appropriate to the team's level
- **Match the user's language.** If the user communicates in Chinese, ask questions and write the spec in Chinese. If in English, use English. Mirror whatever language the user is using.
